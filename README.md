+ **Distributed Scan Tasks**: The framework supports the distribution of scan tasks across multiple machines or devices. This allows for efficient and faster scanning of mobile applications, reducing the overall testing time.

+ **Multiple Scans at a Time**: MAST-F enables the execution of multiple scans simultaneously using the [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html) framework. This feature enhances productivity by allowing users to test multiple mobile applications concurrently.

+ **Analysis for Android and** `[proposed]` **iOS Apps**: The framework supports comprehensive security analysis for both Android and iOS applications. It includes a range of techniques and tools specific to each platform, ensuring thorough testing and identification of vulnerabilities.

+ `[proposed]` **Export to PDF using Pre-defined Templates**: MAST-F offers the ability to export scan reports to PDF format. It provides pre-defined templates based on Word or HTML, allowing users to generate professional and standardized reports for their security assessments.

+ **Visual Comfort**: With DarkMode support, MAST-F transforms its interface into a visually soothing dark theme, reducing the glare emitted by traditional light interfaces.
