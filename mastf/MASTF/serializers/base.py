    As described in the ``ManyToManyField`` class for Django forms, the

    objects by placing their primary key (or specified field name) and de-
    serialize JSON lists or strings into qualified database model objects.

    In this example, we have defined a simple serializer that will convert a
    list of ``Book`` objects into JSON and vice versa. Note that mapper argument
    that is necessary if the primary key is of type ``int``.

        The validated data returned by this field is a tuple that stores the
        retrieved elements and whether they should be replaced with the current
        database values or should be added. Therefore you can add a special
        keyword to the start of the transmitted data:
