# Custom SAST Rules for Android App Security Analysis

This directory serves as a location to place custom Static Application Security Testing (SAST) rules
for identifying possible security risks in Android applications. SAST is an essential process for
detecting vulnerabilities and potential security weaknesses in code before deployment.

Rules are specified by the [`pysast`](https://github.com/MatrixEditor/pysast) tool and can be written in JSON or YAML.
